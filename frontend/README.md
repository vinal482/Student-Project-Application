While installing OpenLogic's Java, set the JAVA_HOME variable and enable the javasoft (oracle) registry keys. If this is not set, you can also define a new JAVA_HOME variable in user and system (environment) variables and set the path as "C:\Program Files\OpenLogic\jdk-17.0.9.9-hotspot\ "

Now, let us install Android Studio. Go to https://developer.android.com/studio and download the latest version ("Hedgehog"). Install it on the C drive and make some space beforehand, as it requires a lot of space. Once installed, open it, go to More Actions and open the SDK Manager. They check all the boxes from SDK platforms and SDK tools, as shown below.

Make sure your Android SDK location is set like mine. Click on Apply and wait. You must set some environment variables for your Android Studio to run properly. Go to environment variables and set new paths, as shown below.
